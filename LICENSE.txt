This distribution of LAPACK contains a modified version of xerbla.f
Copyright (c) 2014 - present OpenGamma, Ltd.
It is present in a file called xerbla.f90 located within the source
at ${ROOT}/BLAS/SRC/xerbla.f90

Internally, we refer to this function as OG_xerbla(), however, due to the
number of references to this routine throughout LAPACK, we have not modified 
the name of the routine in this distribution.

The modifications we made to the XERBLA() subroutine in xerbla.f90 include:
 - The use of a XERBLA_HANDLE module (see file xerbla_handle.f90) to allow a
global state for deciding whether subroutine XERBLA() should call "STOP"
or not. See local modification note in the source.
 - The source now compiles under (though does not comply with) Fortran 90
standards.
